PROJECT: VIRUZVERSE — Full UI + Product Section — React (Vite) application

SUMMARY:
Build a production-ready, multi-page web application for VIRUZVERSE with a futuristic dark UI. Primary purpose: present company solutions, VR/3D work, and a dedicated Products area to display developed projects (cybersecurity modules, apps, VR demos). Provide both public-facing pages and an Admin Dashboard for content & product management.

TECH STACK & DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS:
- React (Vite) with JavaScript (JSX). Use functional components only.
- Prefer minimal dependencies. Allowed: react-router-dom, axios/fetch, small chart lib (recharts) optional. Avoid Tailwind or external CSS frameworks.
- *Styling rule:* Use internal CSS <style> tags and inline CSS properties. Do NOT use external CSS files or Tailwind. Keep design tokens as CSS variables within a root/global <style>.
- Provide a runnable repo structure with README, package.json, and scripts: start (dev), build, preview.
- Include a mock API (json-server or a simple /mock folder with JSON) so app runs without backend.
- Provide clear README with dev setup steps.

BRAND & THEME:
- Background: #0a0a0a
- Text: #ffffff
- Accent gradient (primary): linear-gradient(45deg, #a34b6e 0%, #6e4bc3 50%, #45b7d1 100%)
- Button hover: bright gradient glow using same colors
- Card surface: rgba(255,255,255,0.03) with soft rounded corners (12px)
- Glow & shadow: e.g., box-shadow: 0 8px 30px rgba(110,75,195,0.16); subtle neon border glow on hover
- Fonts: modern sans-serif (Poppins/Inter), fallback system sans-serif
